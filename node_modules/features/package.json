  "readme": "Switchable, modular, stackable features for your code. Turn on any transformations you'd like to use.\n\nUsage example:\n\n    [jann@Jann-PC tmp]$ cat test.xjs\n    // :X-FEATURE: destructure\n    \n    var a, b, c;\n    var val = [{x: 5, y: 6}, 7];\n    [{x: a, y: b}, c] = val;\n    console.log('how it should be: a=5='+a+', b=6='+b+', c=7='+c);\n    [jann@Jann-PC tmp]$ node\n    > require('features')\n    {}\n    > require('./test')\n    how it should be: a=5=5, b=6=6, c=7=7\n    {}\n\nSo, basically, for people who want to use such features:\n\n - install `feature-<name>` modules for the features you want\n - use `.xjs` as file extension\n - in your main script, do this on top: `require('features')`\n - in your scripts, put lines like this one **ON TOP** (no lines, even no empty ones, may be on top of them): `// :X-FEATURE: destructure`\n\nNote that your main script can't use such features - you might want to use a shim script.\n\nAlso note that although this module should just work, the `destructure` feature doesn't do some important things as of 15.01.2012\n(most importantly, caching results).\n\nFor people who want to make features:\n\n - make a new npm package named `feature-<name>`\n - in its main file, add a function `transformCodeString(code)` to the exports\n\nSee https://github.com/thejh/node-feature-destructure/ for an example.\n",
